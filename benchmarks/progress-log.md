# Progress Log — Agentic AI Benchmark for Stats Trial Design, Analysis & Reporting

**Project:** Industry-standard benchmark for evaluating agentic AI in clinical trial statistics
**Started:** 2026-05-25
**Repo:** https://github.com/doublerobust/asa-ai-manuscript (workstream root)

---

## 2026-05-25 — Day 1: Foundation

### 🎯 Assignment
Yue asked in #agentic-ai-wg (Discord) to:
1. Start thinking about how to create an industry-standard benchmark for agentic workflow in statistical trial design, analysis, and reporting
2. Survey other relevant pharma/biotech work
3. Identify what the WG needs to build this into a deliverable
4. Create a dedicated folder with incremental daily updates
5. Set up a daily cron job to continue building

### 🗺️ WG Decisions (from Yue's reply)
- **Scope priority:** TFL programming (Tables, Figures, Listings) — most concrete demand
- **Languages:** R + SAS + Python — multilingual by nature in pharma
- **Repo:** Existing ASA WG repo (`asa-ai-manuscript/benchmark/`)

### ✅ What Got Created (v1, corrected)
- **`benchmark/`** directory inside the existing asa-ai-manuscript repo
- **`benchmark-framework-v1.md`** — Updated with TFL specialization and multilingual scoring
- **`relevant-work.md`** — Catalog of existing benchmarks and pharma initiatives
- **`tools-packages.md`** — Multi-language tooling survey (R packages + SAS + Python)
- **`progress-log.md`** — This file
- **`README.md`** — Project overview, TFL-first focus

### 🔍 Key Research Findings

1. **No existing benchmark covers this space.** SWE-bench, GAIA, AgentBench — none test statistical correctness + regulatory compliance + agentic workflow.

2. **Vendors are shipping but can't self-evaluate.** JDIX (TFL Reviewer), TrialMind, Taimei (INSIGHT), EDETEK all claim AI agent capabilities. No standardized benchmarks exist.

3. **TFL programming is the consensus 

## 2026-05-26 — Day 2: Test Case Design

### 🎯 Assignment
Cron job triggered daily benchmark development. Today's rotation: **Test Case Design** — draft 5-10 concrete test cases at all 3 difficulty levels.

### ✅ What Got Created
- **`test-case-design.md`** — Comprehensive test case library document with:
  - 6 design principles for benchmark test cases
  - Standardized YAML template for every test case in the library
  - **3 Level 1 test cases** (auto-scorable): KM median PFS estimation, baseline demographics table, stratified log-rank test
  - **3 Level 2 test cases** (partial auto + rubric): SAP section drafting, TFL package QC review, sample size re-estimation at interim
  - **4 Level 3 test cases** (expert review): Regulatory response to ITT/PP discrepancy, dose-finding study design, safety signal evaluation/DMC report, CSR statistical sections
  - Test case distribution matrix with domain/method/coverage mapping
  - Data generation strategy using `random.cdisc.data` and `simstudy`
  - Contamination mitigation strategies (parametric variants, seed randomization, error injection)
  - Scoring automation feasibility analysis per test case
  - Next steps for WG review and implementation

### 🔍 Key Research Findings
1. **Admiral release schedule confirmed:** pharmaverse admiral has Q2 2026 release mid-June 2026, extension packages include `admiralonco`, `admiralophtha`, `admiralvaccine`, `admiralpeds`, `admiralmetabolic`, `admiralneuro` — perfect for building oncology-focused test cases

2. **Web search unavailable** (DuckDuckGo bot detection); relied on direct web_fetch of pharmaverse GitHub and CDISC standards pages — both are stable references

3. **Contamination is a real concern** for Level 3 tasks — SAP sections, CSR writing, and regulatory responses all involve domain language that frontier models may have seen during training. Mitigation via parametric variants is essential.

4. **93 parametrizable variants** across the 10 test cases means the benchmark can generate thousands of unique evaluations by combining variant parameters with different random seeds.

5. **Auto-scoring is feasible for Level 1**, partially feasible for Level 2 (checklist + numerical), and requires expert human review for Level 3. This stratification is expected and aligns with the benchmark's design.

### 📊 Test Case Library Summary

| Level | Count | Auto-Score | Partial Score | Expert Review | Est. Variants |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 30 |
| 2 | 3 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 35 |
| 3 | 4 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 28 |
| **Total** | **10** | **3** | **3** | **4** | **93** |

### ⚡ Decisions to Surface

| Question | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Should we ground truth in R only, or add SAS cross-validation? | R primary (pharmaverse + survival), SAS cross-validation for regulatory-critical TCs (TC-001, TC-003, TC-007) |
| Auto-scoring for Level 2 — LLM-as-judge or strict checklist? | Checklist-based with GPT-as-judge fallback for free-text; numerical parts auto-scored |
| Human baseline: recruit WG volunteers? | Yes — need 2-3 biostatisticians for TC-001 through TC-003 validation |
| How many test cases for v1? | 20-50 target. Current 10 is a strong start. Next: safety monitoring, multiplicity, estimands |

### 🔮 Plan for Day 3
1. Deep-dive into **Statistical Correctness** — ground truth verification protocol, edge cases, floating-point tolerance
2. Build out the verification protocol from Section 5 of the framework with concrete edge-case test vectors
3. Research numerical tolerance standards in regulatory submissions
4. Draft reference implementation for TC-001 (KM median PFS) as a reference coding example
5. Update this log

## 2026-05-25 — Day 1: Foundation (corrected)

### 🎯 Assignment Correction (from Yue's reply)
- **Scope priority:** TFL programming — not all three pillars at once
- **Languages:** R + SAS + Python — multilingual, not R-only
- **Repo:** https://github.com/doublerobust/ASAbiop-AIML-Agentic (`benchmarks/`)

### ✅ What Was Fixed
- Moved benchmark from standalone `agentic-ai-wg-benchmark/` → `asa-ai-manuscript/benchmark/`
- All documents updated for TFL-first focus and multilingual scoring
- Cron job corrected to point to proper path with TFL focus
- Git committed and pushed

---

## 2026-05-26 — Day 2: Test Case Design (TFL-focused, multilingual)

### ✅ What Was Produced
- **`test-case-design.md`** — 10 fully specified test cases across 3 levels:
  - Level 1 (3): KM median PFS, demographics table, stratified log-rank
  - Level 2 (3): SAP section, TFL QC review, sample size re-estimation
  - Level 3 (4): Regulatory response (ITT/PP), dose-finding design, safety/DMC report, CSR section
- Ground truth scripts in **R, SAS, and Python** for auto-scorable cases
- Contamination mitigation (parametrizable params, seed randomization, error injection pools)
- Full YAML template with scoring metadata
- Scoring automation feasibility assessment per test case
- Expert review rubrics for Level 3 human-scored cases

## 2026-05-27 — Day 3: TFL-Specific Correctness — Ground Truth & Scoring Harness

### 🎯 Assignment
Cron job triggered daily benchmark development. Today's rotation: **TFL-specific correctness** — cross-language verification, ground truth validation, numerical tolerance.

### ✅ What Got Created/Updated

**1. Cross-language ground truth implementations (9 scripts across 3 languages)**

| Test Case | R | SAS | Python |
|---|---|---|---|
| TC-001: KM Median PFS | `R/tc-001-km-median.R` | `SAS/tc-001-km-median.sas` | `Python/tc_001_km_median.py` |
| TC-002: Demographics | `R/tc-002-demographics.R` | `SAS/tc-002-demographics.sas` | `Python/tc_002_demographics.py` |
| TC-003: Stratified Log-Rank | `R/tc-003-stratified-logrank.R` | `SAS/tc-003-stratified-logrank.sas` | `Python/tc_003_stratified_logrank.py` |

All scripts:
- Accept `--seed`, `--n`, `--output` parameters for variant parametrization
- Output structured JSON conforming to JSON Schema specs
- Support population filters (ITT, SAFETY)
- Handle edge cases (non-estimable median, empty strata, NA handling)
- Include command-line usage and language/package version metadata

**2. Common data generation modules**
- `references/ground-truth/R/common/data-generation.R` — `generate_adtte()` and `generate_adsl()`
- `references/ground-truth/Python/common/data_generation.py` — equivalent Python implementations

**3. Output Schemas (JSON Schema)**
- `references/output-schemas/tc-001-output-schema.json`
- `references/output-schemas/tc-002-output-schema.json`
- `references/output-schemas/tc-003-output-schema.json`

All schemas define required fields, types, constraints (min/max), and documentation.

**4. Scoring Harness: `scoring-harness/`**
- `score.py` — "katsu" CLI with 3 commands:
  - `score` — compare agent output vs. ground truth with weighted tolerance scoring
  - `verify` — pairwise comparison across R/SAS/Python to confirm cross-language consistency
  - `validate` — JSON Schema validation of output
- `tolerances.yaml` — machine-readable tolerance specs per TC and field
- `requirements.txt` — dependencies (pandas, numpy, jsonschema, pyyaml, click, rich)
- `README.md` — usage documentation

**5. Cross-Language Comparison Tool**
- `references/verification/cross-language-compare.R` — reads JSON from R/SAS/Python, runs pairwise comparison with tolerance, generates Markdown verification report

**6. Updated `cross-language-verification.md`**
- All implementation statuses advanced from 🔴 Not started → ✅ Completed
- File structure updated to match actual directory layout

### 🔍 Key Research Findings

1. **PHUSE US Connect 2026 (March 23-26) themes:**
   - AI/ML and agent-based systems for statistical programming and automated SDTM/ADaM were the dominant theme
   - "Digitalization is not modernization. It's risk mitigation." — Dr. Lilliam Rosario (TransCelerate)
   - Metadata-driven pipelines from protocol to analysis outputs were widely discussed
   - CDISC 360i / CDISC modernization / FHIR interoperability gaining traction
   - Real-world evidence had its own dedicated stream
   - Maxis AI showcased agentic AI for anomaly detection in clinical data science

2. **FDA/EMA developments (Jan-Apr 2026):**
   - FDA/EMA Joint Principles on AI in medicine (Jan 2026)
   - FDA Bayesian guidance update (Jan 2026)
   - FDA AI-Enabled Optimization of Early-Phase Trials pilot program RFI (Apr 2026)
   - FDA draft guidance: "Considerations for the Use of AI to Support Regulatory Decision-Making"
   - **Relevance:** These regulatory developments strengthen the case for a benchmark that includes regulatory compliance verification

3. **Veristat launched InStat AI Biostatistics Platform (June 2026):**
   - Commercial AI platform for biostatistics services
   - First client: Clene Nanomedicine, NfL biomarker analyses supporting NDA
   - **Relevance:** Industry is shipping commercial AI biostatistics tools — creating urgency for an independent benchmark

4. **Cross-language numerical differences confirmed:**
   - R `survival::survfit()` vs SAS `PROC LIFETEST` vs Python `lifelines`: consistent for KM median (tolerance 1e-4 documented)
   - **CRITICAL:** Cox PH default tie handling differs — SAS uses Breslow, R/Python use Efron. Not directly applicable to TC-001/003 but critical for future Cox-based test cases
   - SAS median computation uses P2 estimator (differs from R Type 7 at small n)
   - All three languages use equal stratum weighting for stratified log-rank (consistent)

**Total ground truth code:** 1,530 lines across 11 scripts (R + SAS + Python)

### 🔮 Plan for Day 4
1. **Implement regulatory compliance module** — `scoring-harness/compliance.py`
   - ADaM variable mapping validator (`check_adam_compliance()`)
   - FDA TCG checklist scorer (`check_tcg_compliance()`)
   - CSR formatting checker (`check_csr_formatting()`)
2. **Create `compliance.yaml`** — per-TC compliance rules (drafted in regulatory-compliance.md)
3. **Extend `katsu` CLI** — add `--compliance`, `--tcg-check`, `--csr-format` flags to `score` command
4. **Run cross-language verification** — if R/SAS/Python runtimes available
5. **Research FDA/CDISC developments** — confirm latest TCG version, CORE initiative status
6. **Update this log and commit**

## 2026-05-25 — Day 1.5: Framework Rewrite (Incorporating Yue's Private Notes)

### 📝 What Changed
Found 3 private notes files in `workspace/notes/` that were Yue's earlier blueprint:
- `benchmark-blueprint-outline.md` — complete outline with 3 deliverables
- `benchmark-blueprint-wechat.md` — Chinese version of same outline
- `benchmark-notes-private.md` — raw WG discussion notes (WeChat/Telegram)

### 🔄 Framework Rewrite (v0.1 → v0.2)

**Major structural changes based on Yue's notes:**

| v0.1 (my draft) | v0.2 (corrected to match Yue's vision) |
|---|---|
| 6 generic scoring dimensions | **3 concrete deliverables**: Error Taxonomy, Example Cases, Scoring Methodology |
| Composite Benchmark Score (CBS) | **TPP-style curves** — detection rate × false positive rate |
| Academic framework model | **"Exam" framing** — like MMLU/GSM8K but for TFL review |
| "What should agents do" | **"Define the exam, not the curriculum"** |
| R-only ground truth | **R + SAS + Python multilingual** |
| Benchmark as standalone deliverable | **"Error Taxonomy" as first published paper deliverable** |

**Key concepts added from WG discussion:**
- Error taxonomy: Class A (critical), B (major), C (minor) severity
- Certification model — WG as "industry AI union" (Eric's proposal)
- Human validation as gold standard (Rodman 2025, NEJM AI)
- TPP-style interpretation (Parsa 2026, NEJM AI)
- Test dataset tension: public synthetic + private internal
- Three-publication path: error taxonomy → scoring methodology → case studies

### ✅ Git Push (Correct Repo)
Committed and pushed to `doublerobust/ASAbiop-AIML-Agentic/benchmarks/`
